# SolTray

A poor mans [Twinkle Tray](https://twinkletray.com/). Only supports 1 monitor and has no nice fluent design flyout. Set brighness by scrolling the mouse over the tray icon or choose a brightness in the context menu. On the positive side this uses 1-2 Mb of RAM compared to Twinkle Tray's 100+ Mb.
